Secure chat using DES Algorithm
Our system encrypts data over one end and also transmits data over to the other end. The key (Hexadecimal key) generated is sent to the client as a one -time password via E-mail. 
The receiver must enter the same key at his end to decrypt the received message accurately. Thus, we propose a fully automated secure message transfer system that includes encryption as well as key transfer mechanism embedded in a single application that allows for fast, secure and fully automated message transfer using DES algorithm.
